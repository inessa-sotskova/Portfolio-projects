    - price (with a breakdown into categories and subcategories of services);
    - clients (age, gender, demand for certain services)
    

## Libraries used: ##

- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Summary ##

We confirmed that the revenue have significantly increased in 2022 compared to 2021, and that was mostly due to the increase of number of visits, while the contribution of the price factor was about 7%. Then we explored what exactly and to what extent contributed to the increase of visits and what services increased in price the most.
